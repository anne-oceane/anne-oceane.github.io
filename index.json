The world is currently going through a health crisis, which is putting some people in difficulty. Indeed COVID-19, affects companies and people. In one way or another, there is an economic crisis linked to this pandemic. This unforeseen situation increases the risk of default by companies as well as individuals.\nCredit risk is defined as the risk that a borrower will default on its commitments: that it will be unable to keep its promise to pay interest on time or to repay the principal when due.\nHere we try to predict the risk for people to make default giving information about them.\n‚öôÔ∏è Difficulty Most of the time the data we have to learn is unbalanced. In our case for example there are less than 10% of people who have made credits. This makes the training more complicated and leads us to use specialised training techniques for this kind of data.\n  üìà The data description   The dataset includes 5380 uniques clients with 19 differents informations .\n  There are many (13) categorical variables ( Custuomer_Type , Education_level , Marital_status ‚Ä¶) and only 5 numerical data.\n  Many of the explanatory variables are categorical. From then on we understand that one of the determining factors will be the encoding of these variable ,we will discuss this part in the feature engineering section.\n  Exploration\n   The customer category type ‚ÄùP_client‚Äù is an important factor in discriminating those who are most likely to default. We also notice that individuals with an ‚Äùis_closed_date‚Äù of the product are more likely to default than those who do not. Moreover the fact that he is in a ‚ÄùMarital_status‚Äù couple gives him more chance to default than if he was not.  Feature importance\nFeatures importances show that the new features are relevants, so we will use them in training our models to predict credit default.\nü§ñ Our models Sampling Methods\nWe explore two sampling methods:\n Undersapling (Random and NearMiss) Oversampling (Random and SMOTE)  And the best the best sampling method was random over sampling.\nBest Model\nWe train 5 models using this sampling model:\n XGBClassifier  ü•ä Result We train many models using this sampling methods and bellow is our result :\n   ","permalink":"https://anne-oceane.github.io/posts/default/","summary":"In this work , I was trying to predict credit default risk.
